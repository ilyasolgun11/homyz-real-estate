Project README

Hi there, I'm Ilyascan Olgun, and I'm super excited to share with you the amazing project I've built using React. It's a fantastic real estate website that lets you navigate through the areas in London to find different homes.

Features Of the Site 

    React Router: I've utilized React Router to ensure a smooth and seamless browsing experience. By implementing different routes for the home page and individual property pages, I've crafted an intuitive navigation system. You'll find it easy to explore the website and discover properties without any hiccups.

    Filtering: I've taken things up a notch by implementing a powerful filtering mechanism. Now you can easily search for properties based on location, property type, and price range. With each filter selection, the search results dynamically update, giving you the perfect matches every time.

    Responsive Design: I've dedicated considerable effort to creating a responsive design that seamlessly adjusts to various screen sizes. Whether you're using a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, the website will maintain its visual appeal and offer a captivating browsing experience. 

    A Dash of Excitement with Loading Animation: Just to keep things fun and exciting, I've added a nifty loading animation that appears while the search results are being fetched. This not only adds a touch of style but also assures you that the website is hard at work behind the scenes, making sure you get the best results.
